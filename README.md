## Installation Process for Flask

To install Flask, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended). You can use the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

    This will create a new virtual environment named "myenv" in the current directory.

3. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use the following command:

    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS and Linux, use the following command:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Run the following command to install Flask:

    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```
